# MOMM (Moral Oracle for Meaningful Markets)

Welcome! You've found the home of MOMM, a project dedicated to building a new engine for capitalism‚Äîone that rewards ethics, supports people, and heals our planet.

We're not just building a marketplace. We're building a verifiable, community-owned ecosystem to power a regenerative economy. If you're passionate about using technology to create a more just and sustainable world, you're in the right place.

### The Vision: An Antidote to Extractive Commerce

The modern e-commerce model is built on a foundation of exploitation‚Äîof people and the environment. It's a system that optimizes for profit at the expense of our values. **MOMM is the antidote.**

We are building a protocol-first ecosystem that makes ethical commerce programmable. By creating a transparent, verifiable, and decentralized trust layer, we can create a new set of incentives that reward brands for doing good and empower consumers to shop their values with cryptographic certainty.

### Core Components

The MOMM ecosystem is built on three interconnected pillars:

* **üõ°Ô∏è TRUST: The Foundation**
  Our decentralized protocol creates the world's first comprehensive, verifiable database of ethical product information, built on The Graph.

* **ü´Ä HEART: The Personalization Engine**
  An AI-powered system that learns your personal values and filters TRUST data to align products with what matters most to you.

* **üõí MARKET: The Commerce Engine**
  The engine for a new economy where being good is not only easy, it's incentivized. Where every product is verified by TRUST and aligned to your personal values through HEART AI, our response to the current systems harming our world.

### Our Open-Core Model

MOMM operates on an **Open-Core** model. We believe in building public goods while creating a sustainable business to fund the mission.

* **‚úÖ Open Source Core:** The foundational `TRUST` protocol, smart contracts, public API documentation, and the `MARKET` frontend UI are open source. Contributions to these public goods are rewarded with equity and future tokens.

* **üîí Proprietary Layer:** Our competitive advantage‚Äîthe data scraping/normalization engine and the trained `HEART` AI models‚Äîremains proprietary. We generate revenue by selling premium API access and enterprise services.

This creates a powerful loop: revenue from our proprietary services funds the development and growth of the open-source core, ensuring the project's long-term health and rewarding our community of contributors.

### üó∫Ô∏è Our Roadmap

Our development is phased to ensure a robust and scalable foundation.

* **Phase 1: Foundation (In Progress)**
  Building the core TRUST protocol, deploying smart contracts, and scraping initial data from over 50 certification bodies.

* **Phase 2: MARKET Launch (Planned)**
  Launching the beta version of the MARKET platform with our initial cohort of verified brand partners.

* **Phase 3: HEART AI Integration (Planned)**
  Deploying the AI-powered personalization and ethical scoring system to create a truly unique shopping experience.

* **Phase 4: Scale & Governance (Planned)**
  Expanding global certification support, launching an enterprise API, and transitioning to full DAO governance.
